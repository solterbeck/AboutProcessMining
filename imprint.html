        <h2>About the Library</h2>
        <h3>App Information</h3>
        <p>
            This web application was developed using HTML, JavaScript (including jQuery), and Bootstrap. It is hosted as a 
            static site on GitHub Pages at 
            <a href="https://solterbeck.github.io/AboutProcessMining/" target="_blank">https://solterbeck.github.io/AboutProcessMining/</a>. 
            Being a static website, it requires no server-side processing. Data is stored in a public GitHub repository.
        </p>
        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
            Please note that this application is <strong>"Under Construction"</strong> and serves as a learning prototype. 
            Some features and improvements are actively being developed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The links provided in the application include:

        </p>
        <h3>Data Privacy and Protection</h3>
        <p>
            Since the application is hosted on GitHub Pages, the repository "About Process Mining" is public, making 
            data stored within accessible to anyone. Personal information (e.g., names, email addresses, or passwords) 
            is not collected, processed, or stored by this application. Data is only available for viewing as it is 
            provided within the public repository.

        <p>
            Users are encouraged to refrain from submitting sensitive information via links or external sources associated 
            with this application, as GitHub does not provide additional security for public repositories.
