            <p>
                This web application was developed using modern web technologies, including HTML, JavaScript (with jQuery), and Bootstrap. It is hosted as a 
                static site on GitHub Pages at 
                <a href="https://solterbeck.github.io/AboutProcessMining/" target="_blank" class="text-decoration-none">https://solterbeck.github.io/AboutProcessMining/</a>. 
                Being a static website, it requires no server-side processing. All data is stored in a public GitHub repository.
